/**
 * Types main barrel export
 *
 * This file provides a single import point for all commonly used types
 * across the application. It re-exports types from different domains
 * to improve developer experience and maintain clean import statements.
 *
 * Usage examples:
 * import { Organization, Project, UserRoles } from '@/types'
 * import { SearchResult, UploadState } from '@/types'
 * import { CreateProjectFormData, ActionItem } from '@/types'
