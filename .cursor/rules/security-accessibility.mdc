# Security and Accessibility

- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`; if required, sanitize inputs.
- Always include descriptive `alt` text for images; use empty `alt` only for decorative images.
- Use semantic elements (`button`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `h1`â€“`h6`). Set `type="button"` on non-submit buttons.
- Ensure labels/aria for form controls; associate labels using `htmlFor`/`id`.
- Provide visible focus states; ensure sufficient contrast in light and dark modes.
- Keyboard support: all interactive elements must be reachable via tab and operable with keyboard.
- Do not expose secrets to the client; read environment variables on the server only.
