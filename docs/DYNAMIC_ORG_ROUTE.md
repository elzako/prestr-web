# Dynamic Organization Route with Nested Navigation

This feature provides a comprehensive nested routing system that supports:

- `/:organization` - Organization root with top-level projects
- `/:organization/project` - Project folders and content
- `/:organization/project/subfolder` - Nested subfolders (unlimited depth)
- `/:organization/project/subfolder/...` - Deep nested navigation

The system supports unlimited nested folder depth with automatic path resolution.

## Files Created

### Core Route Files

- `src/app/[organization]/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` - Main nested route handler with SSR
- `src/app/[organization]/[[...slug]]/loading.tsx` - Loading skeleton for all nested routes
- `src/app/[organization]/[[...slug]]/not-found.tsx` - Custom 404 for missing folders/projects

### Components

- `src/components/OrgHeader.tsx` - Organization profile header display
- `src/components/ProjectList.tsx` - Top-level project grid with management features
- `src/components/FolderContent.tsx` - Nested folder content display (folders, presentations, slides)
- `src/components/Breadcrumbs.tsx` - Navigation breadcrumb trail

### Configuration

- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` - Server-side Supabase client (already existed, verified compatibility)

## Features

### Organization Profile Display

- Organization name, description, and metadata
- Profile picture or fallback initial
- Website link (if provided)
- Location information
- Tags display
- Responsive design

### Projects List

- Grid layout of top-level projects (folders with `parent_id IS NULL`)
- Project visibility badges (public, private, restricted)
- Client-side search by project name and tags
- Filter by visibility level
- Empty states for no projects or no search results
- Responsive grid (1-3 columns based on screen size)

### Technical Implementation

- **SSR**: Server-side rendering with dynamic metadata generation
- **Caching**: Configurable revalidation (currently set to 0 for development)
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed with database schema types
- **Error Handling**: Proper 404 handling for missing organizations
- **Performance**: Optimized queries with specific field selection

## Database Requirements

The feature expects these Supabase tables:

### `organizations`

- `id` (uuid, primary key)
- `organization_name` (text, unique) - used for URL routing
- `metadata` (json) - contains name, about, website, location, profilePicture, displayMembers
- `tags` (text[]) - array of organization tags

### `folders` (projects)

- `id` (uuid, primary key)
- `folder_name` (text) - project name
- `organization_id` (uuid, foreign key → organizations.id)
- `parent_id` (uuid | null) - null for top-level projects
- `full_path` (text | null) - optional project path
- `tags` (text[]) - array of project tags
- `visibility` (enum: 'public' | 'private' | 'restricted')

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables (should be in `.env.local`):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Usage Examples

### Access Organization Pages

- Visit `/acme` to view the "acme" organization
- Visit `/my-company` to view the "my-company" organization
- Missing organizations automatically show the custom 404 page

### Search and Filter Projects

- Use the search bar to find projects by name or tags
- Use the visibility dropdown to filter by public/private/restricted
- Results update in real-time on the client side

## Performance Notes

- **Caching**: Currently disabled (`revalidate = 0`) for development
- **Production**: Consider setting `revalidate = 3600` for hourly updates
- **Queries**: Optimized to select only necessary fields
- **Loading**: Skeleton loading states for better UX

## Security Considerations

- Read-only database operations
- Assumes proper RLS policies in Supabase
- No authentication required for viewing public organizations
- Visibility filtering respects database enum constraints

## Nested Routing Architecture

### URL Structure

```
/:organization                    → Organization root with projects
/:organization/project            → Project contents
/:organization/project/subfolder  → Nested folder contents
/:organization/project/.../deep   → Unlimited nesting depth
```

### Path Resolution Process

1. Extract organization name from first URL segment
2. Query `organizations` table by `organization_name`
3. If path segments exist, build full path (e.g., "/project/subfolder")
4. Call `get_folder_id_by_full_path(org_id, current_path)` RPC
5. Query folder contents (subfolders, presentations, slides)
6. Render appropriate content with breadcrumb navigation

### Content Types Displayed

- **Folders**: Clickable navigation to deeper levels
- **Presentations**: Individual presentation files
- **Slides**: Individual slide files

### Navigation Features

- **Breadcrumbs**: Full path navigation trail
- **Search**: Cross-content type search within current folder
- **Filtering**: Filter by content type (folders/presentations/slides)
- **Responsive Grid**: Adaptive layout for different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:

- `generateStaticParams` for popular organizations (with privacy considerations)
- Individual presentation and slide detail pages
- Organization member listings (if `displayMembers` is true)
- Project analytics and statistics
- Advanced search with date filters
- Bulk project operations
- File upload and management interface
