## Notes for Implementation

**Priority Order:**

1. Phase 1 & 2 (Foundation) - Week 1
2. Phase 3 (Components) - Week 1-2
3. Phase 5 (E2E Critical Paths) - Week 2
4. Phase 4 (Pages) - Week 2-3
5. Phase 6 (Standards) - Ongoing
6. Phase 7 (Advanced) - As needed

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks for comprehensive foundation, depending on application complexity.

**Key Decisions Needed:**

- Target code coverage percentage
- Which E2E flows are truly critical
- Whether visual regression testing is necessary
- CI/CD platform to use
- Test data management strategy (fixtures vs factories vs generated)
